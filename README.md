## Overview
Solo project to solve a technical challenge with a focus on clean well crafted code. 
Program allows user to manage finances through a simple command line interface. 
## Setup

> require ‘./lib/account’
> account = Account.new
> account.deposit(250)
> account.withdraw(150)
> account.print_statement

```

## Planning and Approach: 
### User Stories
```
As a user
So I can be part of a cashless economy
I want to be able to open an empty bank account
```
```
As a user
So I can store my money securely
I want to be able to deposit it into my account
```
```
As a user
So I can buy things untracked 
I want to be able to withdraw money from my account
```
```
As a user
So I can check how much money I have saved
I want to be able to see my current account balance and transaction history on a printed statement.
```
```
As a user
So I can keep on top of my money habits
I want my account statement to display the date, transaction amount, type, and updated balance.
```
```
As a user
So I can see an up to date history of my transactions
I want to be able to see my account statement listed in reverse chronology by date created
```

#### Edge cases:
```
As a user
So I can stay in the black
I want my account to prevent withdrawal if I have insufficient funds

As a bank manager
So I can ensure the efficient operation of my business
I want to be able to notify customers if they are depositing or withdrawing amounts ≤ £0. 
```

### Acceptance Criteria
Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012<br>
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012 <br>
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012 <br>
When she prints her bank statement she would see:
```
|    date     ||  credit  ||  debit  || balance  |
 ------------------------------------------------
|  14/01/2012 ||          || 500.00  || 2500.00  |
|  13/01/2012 || 2000.00  ||         || 3000.00  |
|  10/01/2012 || 1000.00  ||         || 1000.00  |
```
